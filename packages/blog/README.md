## Introduction
This is a personal blog based on Gatsby.
It gets the artical data from both Wordpress and Markdown.

Tech stack: TypeScript, React, Sass, Eslint, Prettier

## Basics
Start the dev server:
> yarn start

Build artifact:
> yarn build

## Troubleshooting
* When you encounter the situation that the website's behavior does not work with the code changes, you may find it useful by running `yarn clean`
* If you want to test the artifact created from `yarn build`, you can simply run `yarn serve` to start a express http server for the built artifact.
