# 面试题 01.08. Zero Matrix LCCI
Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.

Example 1:
```
Input: 
[
  [1,1,1],
  [1,0,1],
  [1,1,1]
]
Output: 
[
  [1,0,1],
  [0,0,0],
  [1,0,1]
]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: 
[
  [0,1,2,0],
  [3,4,5,2],
  [1,3,1,5]
]
Output: 
[
  [0,0,0,0],
  [0,4,5,0],
  [0,3,1,0]
]
```
