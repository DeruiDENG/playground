# 136. Single Number

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:
```text
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

Example 2:
```text
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```
